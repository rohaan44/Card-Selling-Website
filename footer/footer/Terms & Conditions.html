            <h3 style="color: #9B870C;">Shipping & Delivery Policy</h3>
            <p style="color: #000;">We are only using professional courier services for our customer to make delivery in timely manner. <br>

              For any delay, damage or misplaced by the courier company only courier company will be liable for the same. We are responsible to ship the courier in good condition from our Factory. If you found any damage or open boxes please don’t accept the package and inform us. We will provide you the tracking no. once the goods are shipped so you can track the shipment & get the estimate delivery date. <br>
              If you are ordering from outside Pakistan, you may be charged applicable import duties and taxes by the customs and authorities of the destination country, which will be payable by you. Usually, such duties and taxes are collected from you by the courier companies while delivering your order. We do not maintain any information on them since they are outside our purview.
            </p>

              Following terms apply <br>

Shipping cost from Pakistan to the destination (delivery) point will be deducted. This is because lot of money is spent in shipping so this cannot be done away with. <br>
5% of the total costs incurred will be retained as processing fee. <br>
Shipping cost to send the goods back to our address in PAKISTAN is to be borne by you. <br>
Refund will be initiated after receipt of the goods in good condition. <br>
In cases where you have bought the samples before making a bulk order and now need to return the goods on grounds of your not liking the design and/or product, paper, +_10% color variation from the online sample, this is totally dis-allowed. When you have seen sample and made an order after seeing them, NO RETURN AND NO REFUND POLICY is applied. <br>
In some cases it is seen sometimes a family member sees the card and when the final order is received, someone from the family do not like the card and exchange or refund is requested. In such cases NO RETURN AND NO REFUND POLICY is applied as the choice was made and goods sent after seeing the product. <br>
Most of the claims arise due to the fact that people don’t like the product. To overcome this issue, it is recommended that you purchase a sample first. Printed cards cannot be returned for refunds on grounds of your not liking the design and/or product, paper, color variation from the online samples. When sample could have been bought and the sample service wasn’t used, our company cannot be held liable for the same. <br>
